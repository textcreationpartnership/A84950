            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Full ACCOUNT of a moſt Tragycal and <hi>Inhuman Murther,</hi> That was Committed lately in <hi>Holland,</hi> at <hi>Sevenbergen,</hi> 3 Hours Walk off the <hi>Brill,</hi> by One CLAES WELLS; Who murthered his Father, <hi>Henry Wells</hi> and his Mother; with 3 Brothers and one Siſter: And after ſat the Houſe on Fire, for which he was Executed, within 3 days after.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>If ever there were a Subject that was capable of attracting the Wonder and infuting Amazement to all Mankind, I think this preſent Occaſion, will afford as large as ever happened in this World; and I am perſwaded, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a moſt ſerious Conſideration both of too ſevere Parents, and too diſobedient and extravagant Sons. This diſmal Story being the effect of both thoſe ſad Errors, tho' indeed, even</hi> Nero'<hi>s Cruelty is not comparable to that of this Monſter, nor the moſt exquiſite Torments, ſufficient to expiate ſuch a barbarous and unnatural Action, as will preſently appear.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THIS <hi>Claes Wells</hi> (by what I could learn) had received as large Education as his Father could poſſibly give him; and endowed him alſo with a ſufficient Wealth to live happily, and was for ſome time in a fair way of being a Comfort to his Aged Parents: But alas! Falling into bad Company and by its Temptations and Allurements, conſuming his Patrimony, he loſt the Favour of his Friends; and for 4 years paſt, would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nor admit him in their Sight, till lately, when in Humility, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching and intreating his Mother, with Sighs and Tears, and a pretended Sorrow for his Offence, ſhe harboured him again; and uſed her utmoſt Efforts upon her Husband, but in vain, being by no Intreaties
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150056:2"/> to be prevailed upon; His Brothers and Siſters Embraced him with a Joy not to be expreſſed, mingling with their Endearments a thouſand Kiſſes, and confirmed their Brotherly Affection by imploring on their Knees a Reconciliation with their Father; and that he would condeſcend an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his preſence, but his Anger was too inveterate, and their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers proved ineffectual: So he was conveyed up Stairs, and being told of it, fell immediately into a Fit of Diſtraction. However, being qualifyed and Silence engaged, leſt his Father ſhould have known he was in the Houſe, and thereby incurred all their Ruin; when his Father went to Bed he came down, and Eat his Supper with a ſeeming Satisfaction; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten, going to reſt with his elder Brother, (they little thinking of his Deſign) at 12 a Clock, and being faſt aſleep, he cut his Throat firſt; and having a Dark Lanthorn; entred next unto the other Chamber, where 2 more of his Brothers lay, where he cut their Throats alſo; then he went into his Siſters, and cut her's; and laſtly come to his Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that received him, and cut her Throat, who ſtruggling, and awaking his Father, he Cryed out, Son, let me live, I'll give you all I have, but could not be prevailed upon; ſo ſtabbed him, and after, ſat Fire to the Houſe, which, allarming the Inhabitants, who ſecuring the Draw-Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Town, ſearch was made, and finding him; knowing the Grudge; charged him with it; which not having power to deny, was immediately conveyed to the Goal, where behaving himſelf with all the Outrages of a terrified Conſcience; as Curſing his whole Family, and crying out for Damnation; The whole Confeſſion in his moſt ſober Intervals were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That his Father was the Cauſe; When he came upon the Scaffold, and ſaw the Fate he was to ſuffer, he laughed at firſt, then Rav'd; the manner of his Execution being thus; It is the Cuſtom in <hi>Holland</hi> to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute in the middle of the Town upon a Scaffold before the Stadthouſe; where was placed a large ſquare Hearth of Bricks, and a Fire being kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, this Malefactor was hanged up by his left Leg upon an Iron Gibbet, at ſome ſmall diſtance, and was waſted until he expired; The Spectators of this Tragedy, rather upbraided than pitied him, and the Tumult could hardly forbear tearing him Piece meal</p>
            <p>This ſad Cataſtrophe may be a warning to Children, firſt to be Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and keep within bounds; but more particularly, to avoid bad Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which was the deſtruction of This, and is of many more Youths in <hi>England</hi> and elſewhere; And Secondly, to Parents, not too much by Severity to expoſe their Children to Want, and provoke them to Wrath; both being the Cauſes of ſuch direful Effects, 'tis hoped this Paper will be a Means to Cure the Licentiouſneſs of the former, and the Inveteracy of the latter. </p>
